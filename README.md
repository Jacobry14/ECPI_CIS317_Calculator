# ECPI_CIS317_Calculator

This was the final project for my CIS317 Advance OOP with C# durring my time at ECPI

The concept of this project was to encapsulate everything that we learned durring the course, like manipulating data value with the gui system we were using at the time.

While the calculator was simple connecting all of the arrays and buttons together was a challenge.
